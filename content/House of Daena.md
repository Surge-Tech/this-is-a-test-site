The House of Daena (HOD for short) is a housing dorm at [[Kyokuse Institute for the Magically Inclined]]. This year was it's turn to house first years and the party got lucky (or unlucky) to be assigned here!

The House of Daena has lots of secrets, including but not limited to:
* A Hidden Library
* Bedrooms that can change in size and contents
* The best Campus Guide on campus!
* The list goes on... maybe
